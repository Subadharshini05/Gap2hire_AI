# Learning Log – Hackathon 1

## Hour 1

In the first hour, I focused on understanding the hackathon problem statements and deciding on the right project idea. I went through the given topics and compared them based on how well they fit the hackathon requirements, especially prompt engineering and structured outputs.

After evaluating the options, I finalized the topic **Gap2Hire AI – Resume Gap Analyzer & Mock Interview Coach**. I chose this idea because it solves a real problem where users don’t clearly know why their resumes get rejected, and it also allows me to use prompt chaining and JSON-based AI responses effectively.

Once the topic was finalized, I spent time understanding the problem better and thinking about the solution flow. The idea is to analyze a resume against a job description, identify gaps, generate targeted mock interview questions, and provide structured feedback to improve the resume.

Next, I finalized the tech stack for the project. I decided to use **React** for the frontend, **Node.js and Express** for the backend, and an LLM for the AI logic using prompt engineering. I also planned to keep the AI responses in a structured JSON format.

After that, I created a new GitHub repository named **gap2hire-ai**. I initialized Git locally, opened the project in **VS Code**, set up the basic folder structure, and added the initial files. I then made my first commit and pushed the code to GitHub.

Overall, this hour helped me clearly define the project direction, finalize the tech stack, and set up the repository properly to start development smoothly.
